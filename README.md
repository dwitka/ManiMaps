### ManiMaps

# Project Description
ManiMaps is currently a working python application that uses the Google Maps API to extract distances between addresses. 
The app.py module reads a standard text file where each line consists of an address, it builds an http request and sends
it to google's servers. The app receives a json response which is refined and structured. Access to the app is gained 
through a CLI.
